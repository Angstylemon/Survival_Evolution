============================================================

Genetic algorithm that allows units to evolve in order to survive

How it works:
- Each unit can move at different speeds and with different accuracy
- Units constantly lose health (aging)
- Units must eat food (green) to increase their health. Food supply gradually diminishes
- If units eat poison (red), their health drastically decreases
- When health runs out, units die
- At a given threshold population, reproduction will occur
- The longer surviving units are more likely to reproduce
- Each unit of the same colour is the same (same DNA)
